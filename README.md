# India-Gender-and-Region-Type-Analysis
This notebook analyzes India gender population data (2011) and enriches it with region type (state v UT) from a caste/region scaffold. It produces insights and visualizations, and saves cleaned outputs for reuse.  - Data sources used here are local CSVs provided in the workspace.-The caste CSV is a scaffold; only region_type is used for enrichment.
